                This creates a rectangular box in HTML with a specific class name 
                "rectangle" and applies styling using CSS. Adjust the width, height, 
                background color, border size, and other properties according to your design requirements.
                 You can place this code within your HTML file between 
                 tags or link an external CSS file using <link> tags.
                    Remember, this is a very basic example. The look and feel can be customized extensively by adding more CSS properties and by using frameworks like Bootstrap or other CSS libraries to make the design responsive and visually appealing.
